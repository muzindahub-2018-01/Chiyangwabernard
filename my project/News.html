When you work in the restaurant industry or catering world, you will discover quite a lot of aspects to your business that have to have consideration.

<em>As well as being able to cook, you'll have to hire and train your workforce, set up your supply chain, market your restaurant, handle your cash flow, provide professional front of house service and also make certain your food looks wonderful when you serve it. Each and every one of these responsibilities are of vital importance towards the success of your business. For example there's no point in being the best chef in the world if no one goes to your restaurant. You have to get the marketing correct to fill your tables. Your team need to be prepared well and be knowledgeable on the dishes you're offering, because if your service is inadequate, your client will not return even if your food is superb!</em>
